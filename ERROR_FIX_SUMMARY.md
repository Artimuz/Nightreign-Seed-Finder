# Session Cleanup Error Fix

## Problem
Console error showing "Error cleaning up sessions: {}" was occurring because:

1. **Empty error objects**: When Supabase operations fail in development or with connection issues, the error object can be empty or undefined
2. **Poor error handling**: The original code didn't handle cases where the mock Supabase client is used
3. **Misleading error messages**: Errors in development mode were logged as actual errors instead of expected warnings

## Root Cause
- The mock Supabase client doesn't support all operations like `lt()` filtering
- When network connectivity is poor or in development mode, Supabase operations can fail with empty error objects
- The error logging didn't properly stringify error objects

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved `cleanupExpiredSessions()` in `queries.ts`
- **Added capability check**: Verify if `lt()` method exists before using it
- **Better error handling**: Distinguish between development/production errors
- **Enhanced logging**: Properly stringify error objects to avoid empty "{}" logs
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Handle mock client scenario gracefully

### 2. Enhanced `useUserCounter` hook
- **Better error messages**: Improved error stringification
- **Clearer logging**: Distinguish between expected development behavior and actual errors
- **Return value handling**: Check the boolean return value from cleanup function

### 3. Error Message Improvements
- Development mode: Log as warnings instead of errors
- Production mode: Provide meaningful error context
- Empty errors: Stringify properly to show actual content

## Expected Results
- ✅ No more "Error cleaning up sessions: {}" console errors
- ✅ Clear distinction between development warnings and production errors  
- ✅ Better debugging information when actual errors occur
- ✅ Graceful handling of mock/development environments

## Files Modified
1. `src/lib/database/queries.ts` - Improved cleanup function error handling
2. `src/hooks/useUserCounter.ts` - Enhanced error reporting in cleanup calls

The error was cosmetic but indicated poor error handling practices. This fix provides better developer experience and clearer debugging information.
